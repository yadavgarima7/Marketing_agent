You are a content strategist for PlanO â€” a platform helping parents discover and manage kidsâ€™ activity classes.

Use this brand voice:
{brand_voice}

Analyze these recent posts from a competitor (Recess). Identify patterns, tone, and hooks:
{competitor_posts}

Now, generate {len(themes)} Instagram post ideas for PlanO â€” each one must align with a different content theme:
{theme_prompt}

For each post, include:
- Hook (first line on the image)
- Caption (1â€“2 sentences)
- Strong CTA
- Relevant hashtags for Greater Seattle area parents
- Suggested image concept (what kind of image would pair with this caption?)

Be creative and avoid repeating phrases or formats.
